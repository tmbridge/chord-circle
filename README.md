# chord-circle
A Chord Circle Generator and Randomizer

TODO:
- Populate slices from form data
- Show chord diagram popup overlay when hovering over a 'slice' (https://github.com/acspike/ChordJS)
- Form fly-out or overlay
- Allow as many or as few chords in a circle as you want (up to a limit)
- Button to randomize order of chords within circle
- 8-button chord-type selector next to field inputs (open, barre (root 6 or 5), triad (root 1-6)) (maybe barre & triad will expand to show root options)
- Color code slice backgrounds based on chord-type (open, barre, triad)
- Color code slice text color base on root string, maybe? (Root 6 or 5 (Barre), Root 1-6 (Triad))
- Presets (e.g. all chords in a key)
- Browser-based memory & favorites (using previously created preset functionality)
- Print friendly css
- Decide how to handle CAGED grips -- Consider them Barres with roots on 1-4 or as a distinct chord-type?
